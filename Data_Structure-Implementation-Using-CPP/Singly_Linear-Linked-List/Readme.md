# Singly_Linear_Linked_List (C++)

This repository contains a Singly Linear Linked List implementation in C++ language. It is designed for learning and practicing Data Structures concepts such as dynamic memory allocation, pointers, and linked list operations using object-oriented programming.

A singly linear linked list is a collection of nodes where:

Each node stores data

Each node contains a pointer to the next node

The last node points to NULL

## Data Structure Used
```
struct node
{
    int data;
    node *next;
};
```
## Operations Implemented

Insert node at first position

Insert node at last position

Insert node at given position

Delete node from first position

Delete node from last position

Delete node from given position

Display all elements

Count number of nodes

## How to Compile and Run
g++ Filename.cpp -o Myexe

./Myexe

## Concepts Covered

Dynamic memory allocation (new, delete)

Pointers and structures

Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

Linear data structures

Linked list traversal
